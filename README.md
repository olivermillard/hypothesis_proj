Hypothesis Autocomplete Project
===============================

#### Main Component
- `AutoCompleteInput`
Provides a textarea which can be written in. When a user types in a word beginning with @ (the query selector), a box will appear with the profiles of users whose name/username matches the query. If the user only inputs @, they will be shown all users in the database. If there are no profiles found, the user will be told this. The user can click on one of the profiles and the name from that profile will replace the first valid query written in the textarea.
